BCN3D+ Manuals
==============

![Close up view of the printer](http://reprapbcn.github.io/images/manuals.jpg)

We've made some pretty awesome manuals to help you assembling the BCN3D+. We have two versions, the **PDF** and the **3DVIA**. All the manuals are based on the 3D model of the printer, so you'll be able to see 3D assemblies with all the parts and pieces.

Again, the manuals are supposed to guide you in the process of assembling the printer. If you detect any mistake or improvement, please let us know by submitting and Issue in the git repo.

The good stuff comes when you use the 3DVIA manuals. An executable application lets you rotate, zoom and select the parts in a 3D dimensional way. Easy as pie!
